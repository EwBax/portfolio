                    <article>
                        <p>An Android application that is a mock ordering system for a Pizza restaurant. Orders created are saved to a SQLite database, and all saved orders can be viewed and updated/deleted from within the appliation. The application can
                            also switch between English and French the fly, and remembers the language selection.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>This application was a school assignment to practice using Android Shared Preferences, and performing
                            <i>CRUD</i> (Create Read Update Delete) operations with a database. The program was written with Java and developed using Android Studio.
                        </p>
                    </article>
                    <h2>Development Process</h2>
                    <article>
                        <p>This assignment was part of my Android development course, and was the final assignment of the course. Before this point in the course, I had already developed a calculator app and a quiz app, but had not made an application with
                            navigation back and forth between pages (activities). This didn't end up being the tricky part of the assignment, though; that would be the translation between English and French at the push of a button in the app.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I built the language switching functionality using the built in localization functionality in Android. Android's Localization will choose which resource dictionary to use for text in the app based on the locale of the device using
                            the app. I programmed the button to switch the app to use the French locale resources and reload the current page, but for some reason it would still display English. I spent some time researching and testing possible solutions
                            to my problem, but in the end the best approach I found was to have a function that manually sets all the text on the page with the new locale's resources.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>To handle the CRUD operations in the app, I wrote a java database adapter and an order model to store the data for individual orders. To display the order history I used a custom XML control for each row displayed in a RecyclerView.</p>

                    <h2>Reflections</h2>
                    <article>
                        <p>This application was interesting to make. It wasn't particularly enjoyable, I think because it's just a mock app, but it was educational. I improved my skills developing Android applications during this project, and got expecience
                            using databases and stored preferences to remember data from the apps. After developing this application, I now feel like I have the ability to develop any app that I have an idea for.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>One of the reasons this course was my favorite is because I was able to load the apps I made onto my phone and show anybody! Before this, all of the applications I had made required a computer to use, and most of them were command
                            line based. Having the Android apps I developed installed on my phone made it much easier to show people, and the apps themselves felt like a better display of my skills than most of my previous school projects. Once I have
                            more free time in my life, I want to revisit Android development and make an app I will enjoy working on.
